# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time.  A user will enter an initial investment, a monthly deposit, the annual interest rate, and the number of years.  A table will display with the balance of the account each year without the monthly deposit, then a table will display the balance each year with the monthly interest.
# What did you do particularly well?
Use of functions.  It is my goal to have minimal code in my main.  I created stubs initially so that I could work each portion piece by piece.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I used windows specific code, such as system(“CLS”).  I could have also used more functions to break up my code more.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Oddly enough, the formatting of the table was the most challenging portion for me.  I could not get the tables to look right.  Finally, after some Google searches, I utilized a string stream to format the output.
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The use of functions and classes transferred well into the next projects.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used functions, classes, and descriptive variable names.
